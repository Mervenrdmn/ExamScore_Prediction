# Exam Score Prediction 📊

This project presents a comprehensive **regression analysis** aimed at predicting exam scores. The study includes data preprocessing, evaluation of different scenarios, and performance comparison of various regression algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Description
- The dataset was examined for **missing values** and **duplicate records**.  
- The **gender variable** has three categories: `male`, `female`, `other`.  
- Since the "Other" category accounts for about one-third of the dataset, two scenarios were considered:  
  1. **Scenario 1:** The "Other" category was completely removed.  
  2. **Scenario 2:** The "Other" category was marked as **NaN**.  

In both scenarios:
- Data preprocessing steps (**encoding** — One-Hot Encoding & Ordinal Encoding — and **scaling**) were applied.  
- Several regression algorithms were tested:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Lasso / LassoCV  
  - Ridge / RidgeCV  
  - ElasticNet / ElasticNetCV  
  - SVR  
  - K Neighbors Regressor  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Adaboost Regressor  
  - Gradient Boost Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
  - LightGBM Regressor  

**Findings:** Despite removing one-third of the dataset, model performance did not show significant differences. Both approaches achieved approximately **70% R² scores**.
